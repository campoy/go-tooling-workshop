# Managing Source Code

In this section we will cover all the different tools that gophers use to manage their
code bases. This includes:

- [1: Worskpace management](1-workspace/1-intro.md) - how to organize a workspace according to Go best practices.
- [2: Edition tools](2-writing/1-editors-and-plugins.md) - tools to help writing code, such as editors, plugins, and pretty printers.
- [3: Navigation tools](3-reading/1-godoc.md) - tools to understand and navigate existing code bases.

Everything here is related to source code, in the next section we cover how from that code
you can build artifacts such as binaries and container images.
