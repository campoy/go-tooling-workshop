# Building Artifacts From Code

In this section we will learn how to generate artifacts from
Go code that allows us to run the code in some specific platform.

Go can be compiled to static binaries. These binaries are specific to
a given platform and architecture, but we will also see how we can
cross-compile to generate binaries for platforms we don't have access to.

We will also cover some cool techniques to embed assets into our static
binaries to simplify deployment.

There's a lot of material to cover in this section, so let's get
started with the [first chapter](1-go-build.md) and learn how to compile a simple Go program.
