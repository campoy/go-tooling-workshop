# Congratulations!

Seriously, this was a long workshop and you rocked it all the way!

If you enjoyed the workshop make sure you give me a shoutout on Twitter, I'm
[@francesc](https://twitter.com/francesc). If you didn't like it, let me know why!

If you find something broken remember to file an issue on this repo, or if you have
questions too.

I hope you enjoyed it as much as I did writing it, and I hope you learned a ton.
