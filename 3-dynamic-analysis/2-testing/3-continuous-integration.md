This section is unfortunately not ready yet.
But you can follow the instructions on [this page](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/configure-travis-ci-for-go)
in order to set up your own continuous integration check with TravisCI.

It is defintely worth it, so give it a try. Also, if you want
to contribute the content of this page I definitely accept Pull Requests!

## Congratulations

Yeah, I know. This page is empty. But please continue this workshop.
We will discuss performance analysis with the [next chapter](../3-profiling/1-benchmarks.md).
