# Dynamic Program Analysis

So far we have worked only with code and the results of its compilation.
But when we write code it is, first and for all, to run it! And when we run code
we want our programs to be correct, robust, and as fast as possible.

- [1: Debugging](1-debugging/1-delve.md) - the basics of Go debugging with delve
- [2: Unit Testing](2-testing/1-go-test.md) - how to write and run unit tests in Go
- [3: Profiling](3-profiling/1-benchmarks.md) - benchmarks, profiling, and flame graphs!
- [4: Tracing](4-tracing/1-tracing.md) - tracing Go programs for deeper understanding

Let's [get started](1-debugging/1-delve.md)!
